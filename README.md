# OSU! Discord Bot

## Description

The osu Discord Bot is a work-in-progress bot built with `discord.js` that provides various functionalities related to osu! game data. Currently, the bot supports commands for retrieving beatmap information and user data.

This project aims to improve my own API and JavaScript ES6 skills.

## Current Commands

- **`/get-beatmap <beatmap_url>`**: Fetches details about a specific osu! beatmap using its beatmap url.
- **`/get-user <user_url>`**: Retrieves information about an osu! user using their user url.
- **`/get-user-by-name <username>`**: Fetches information about an osu! user using their username.
